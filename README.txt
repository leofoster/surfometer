What is popping my dude?

This piece of program was created by u/fuckinglemons
for reading surf height and displaying it on a neat lil interface
I am by NOOOOO Fekin means a proffesional and there very well might be errors in this program
I have customized it for my use but it can easily be repurposed for you
otherwise youll be getting the forecast for Bermuda, where its not ideal surf and the green light will be on 9/10 times
the program comes with a metres to feet converter because by default magicseaweed uses metres and trust me it gets complex if you dont really know
the unit but yeah anyway on your pi you is gonna need to pull up a gpio pin diagram and **pull out** hah your breadboard resistors and LEDs
i will upload an image as soon as i can
and for initial setup you will need to install beautifulsoup and urllib5 
then follow the instructions in the code
